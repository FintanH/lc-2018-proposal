**Abstract Title**: Read The Functional Manual: But First We Need to Write It

**Abstract Topic**: Documentation Writing, Community Interaction, Open Source Contributions

**Submission Type**: Educational Session (50m)

**Abstract Summary**:
Documentation can be critical to the use of a library. In the Haskell community we are constantly relying on open source tools and libraries and we rely on the documentation to follow how the code works or how the tool is used. I have personally come across libraries where I was welcomed by a lack of documentation on how to wield someone's library. At times the only documentation is a puzzle in the form of some category theory and a link to the research paper. At other times the library maintainer could not find the time to write documentation (we are busy humans after all). This can be frustrating to come across because it means time wasted by digging into the innards. We want to make these Haskell libraries appeal to the masses and dispel the stigma of our libraries being poorly documented. To do this I will build a narrative around the different categories of documentation starting from the most minimal, types and descriptions, up to the more involved such as tutorials/code labs and blog posts. I will also add my personal experience of how I started in Haskell open source software and how a lot of it revolved around documentation.

For each of the aforementioned categories I will examine a few aspects around the documentation. For each one, I will look at how documentation can aid the workflow of the author and at what stages the author should consider writing the different kinds of documentation. I will look at how documentation can aid newcomers that come along to the library and how each category will affect the usefulness to a beginner of the library.

I will take examples of each category of documentation and pick a library that does a good job demonstrating the power of each type of documentation and also find examples of where a library fails to meet the requirements of being helpful documentation-wise. These examples will give the audience some ideas of where they can contribute.

I will then talk tackle the issue of how newcomers can help out with documentation, giving my personal account on some of the libraries I contributed to such as "esqueleto" and "proto-lens". I will cover how to make a pull request on GitHub if people are unfamiliar, and do a live demonstration of making a pull request on an example library to help demonstrate the point; with audience participation of course. I will cover how a pull request can range from a change in a typo all the way up to more significant input such a full code setup tutorial. The idea is to engage the audience into participating in the Haskell community not just at a code level but also the documentation level, since pull requests do not always have to be about features and bugs; but in reality lack of documentation is a bug where it stops people using your library, so we should submit bug fixes.

**Content Relevancy**: Useful for everybody.
