**Abstract Title**: Read The Functional Manual: But First We Need to Write It

**Abstract Topic**: Documentation Writing, Community Interaction, Open Source Contributions

**Submission Type**: Educational Session (50m)

**Abstract Summary**:
Documentation can be critical to the use of a library. In the Haskell community we are constantly relying on open source tools and libraries and we rely on the documentation to follow how the code works or how the tool is used. I have personally come across libraries where I was welcomed by a lack of documentation on its use. At times the only documentation is a puzzle in the form of some category theory and a link to the research paper. At other times the library maintainer could not find the time to write documentation. This can be frustrating to come across because it means time wasted by digging into the innards. We want to make these Haskell libraries appeal to the masses and dispel the stigma of our libraries being poorly documented. To do this I will present a discussion on the different categories of documentation starting from types and descriptions up to tutorials and blogs.

For each category I will examine a few aspects around the documentation. I will look at the relationship between documentation and author workflow, the help it gives newcomers and the usefulness of a library. I will take examples of each category of documentation and pick a library that does a good job demonstrating the power in each category and also find examples of where a library fails to meet the requirements of being helpful.

I will give my personal account on some of the libraries I contributed to such as "esqueleto" and "proto-lens". I will go through how to make a pull request, with a live demonstration, and how users can contribute to documentation no matter how small or large. In reality lack of documentation is a bug where it stops people using your library, so we should submit bug fixes.

**Content Relevancy**: Useful for everybody.
